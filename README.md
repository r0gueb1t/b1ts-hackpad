<h3><b>Case:</b></h3><br>
I won't be using a case because this is exactly what I need! Raw, unfiltered, exposed. That's how I like my gadgets. (No, it's not because I can't design a case, I just felt that it looked better without it.) However, I do plan on developing a case, maybe in a few months when school is over, so I added the necessary parts in the BOM.

<h3><b>BOM:</b></h3>
Here's what I used for the device:
<ul>
  <li>1x XIAO_RP2040 module</li>
  <li>4x Cherry MX Switches</li>
  <li>4x DSA Keycaps</li>
  <li>1x EC11 Rotary Encoder</li>
  <li>2x SK6812 Mini LEDs</li>
  <li>4x M3x16mm screws</li>
  <li>4x M3x5mmx4mm inserts</li>
</ul>
